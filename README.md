Source for [my website](https://william278.net), built in Vue.js using Nuxt 3. If you'd like to use this as a base for your site, it should be OK, but get in touch with me first!

## Translations
Check the [translations page](/content/translate.md) for information about how you can help translate this site!

## Setup
Navigate to the root directory and run `npm install` to get the packages, then run `npm run dev` to start the server. 
You can set the following environment variables to set the port and the hostname:

* `HOST` - The host the server will listen on. Defaults to `localhost`.
* `PORT` - The port the server will listen on. Defaults to `8000`.

To deploy for production, run `npm run build` to build the site, then you can deploy that through a node web server via `node .output/server/index.mjs`. Check the nuxt docs for more deployment options, etc.
